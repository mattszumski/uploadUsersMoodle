List of things that can be improved:
1. Error msgs -> split for categories, so user knows what kind of error he/she is dealing with
2. Improvement of the msg ( css)
3. Information to user how many rows have been correctly set up
4. Checking db for organizational unit & position before inserting - now they could duplicate
5. Improvements of the landing page (css)
